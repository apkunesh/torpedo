# Welcome to Torpedo! 

A game known by few and loved by fewer! This is a six-round, two-stage, turn-based, hand-seeking game played with two decks of 54 standard playing cards (including Jokers). The goal of each round is to minimize the number of "points" in your hand by either "laying down" or discarding high-point cards.

Torpedo, also known as "That Damned Women's Game," was introduced to the Walljasper family at least 3 generations ago. It continues to be played at tables spanning the US, North-to-South and East-to-West.

As the family has expanded to ever-further distances, it has become hard to play the game regularly. This project attempts to bridge the gap with online functionality and a not-too-clunky GUI.

# The Rules

Torpedo is fundamentally about "building hands." There are six hands, each of which is made up of two fundamental elements: "Book" and "Run." A book is a three-of-a-kind, pure and simple. Examples include AAA, 333, JJJ, QQQ of any suit. A run is a straight-flush of length four. Examples include AS 2S 3S 4S, 3D 4D 5D 6D, 10C JC QC KC. Notably, Aces can be high or low in a run, but you cannot "wrap around," as in QS KS AS 2S. Another quick note: Jokers are wild, meaning that they can fill the role of any card. A book could be composed of A A JOK. A run could look like 10C JOK QC KC.

The six rounds are: Two Books; Two Runs; Two Books and a Run; Two Runs and a Book; Three Books; and Three Runs.

## The Setup

To begin, shuffle two decks, including jokers. The first dealer, typically, is the one who suggested the game. Deal 9 cards to each player.  The first player to take a turn is always to the left of the dealer; play passes to the left, as does the deal.

## A Useful Construct

First, an essential dichotomy. There are two "phases" in any of the six rounds of Torpedo. 

Players in the "caterpillar" phase:
* Attempts to form the hand, in order to "lay down"
* Attempts to wildly throw cards if players in the second phase are on the verge of emptying their hand

Players in the "butterfly" phase:
* Have laid down
* Can extend the laid elements (books, runs) of other butterflies
* Seek to end the game by emptying their hand with a discard

All players start out as "caterpillars." There is no way to win in the caterpillar phase; players stuck in the caterpillar phase at the end of the game will almost certainly be stuck with the most points. (This is called "getting caught with a mitfull.")
